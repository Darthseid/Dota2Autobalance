# Dota2Autobalance
A simple mod I am creating. It is a Dota 2 but script for the Steam Workshop. The purpose is that every 3 minutes, the best player on the winning team switches places with the worst player on the losing team. Each player keeps their heroes, but they completely swap teams. The mod is semi-functional, but there are 3 main issues right now.

1. Illusions, summons, and clones won't get swapped along with the player and hero.
2.  I'm having a real hard time trying to display the swap information to all players in chat.
3.  The panorama does not update when the heroes swap.
4.  Couriers do not swap with their heroes, yet can still deliver items. Couriers are invulnerable in this game mode.
